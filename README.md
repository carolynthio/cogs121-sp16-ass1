## Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

### Visibility of system status
When users first log onto the page there is a message that is displayed to let the user know that their username and password are being authenticated and that it may take a few minutes until they successfully enter the webapp.

### Match between system and the real world
The diction that we utilize throughout our webapp is familiar to students who study at UCSD, which is our target audience. We also utilize labels that are self explanatory to eliminate confusion.

### User control and freedom
The user is able to freely navigate from one page to another through the navigation bar at the top of the page.

### Consistency and standards
We utilize a consistent theme throughout all our pages.

### Error prevention
By providing instructions on what to do on the messages page, we are preventing users from encountering the error of submitting a blank message.

### Recognition rather than recall
We give users a basic template on how to structure their message so they are not confused of what to type.

### Flexibility and efficiency of use
We allow users to press enter to submit a message rather than making them click a button, making it a faster process.

### Aesthetic and minimalist design
The navigation bar is always on the top of each page and titles are clearly visible indicating where the users are in our webapp.

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
On our messages page, when a user enters a blank message an error popups allowing the user to realize that they are trying to send a blank message.

### Help and documentation
We provide a help page for users who may be confused on how to utilize our webapp.
